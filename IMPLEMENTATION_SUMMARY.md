# Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete multiperson chat backend has been successfully implemented using Django 5.2.7 and Django REST Framework. The application provides a robust authentication system with user role management, multi-person chat rooms, and persistent message history stored in SQLite.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication System
- **Registration**: Users can create accounts with username, email, password, and user type
- **Login**: Session-based authentication for secure access
- **Logout**: Proper session cleanup
- **User Types**: Three distinct user roles:
  - **Owner**: For owners/administrators
  - **Student**: For students
  - **University Staff**: For university staff members

### 2. Custom User Model
- Extended Django's AbstractUser with a `user_type` field
- Integrated with Django's authentication system
- Full admin interface support with user type filtering

### 3. Chat Management
- Create multi-person chat rooms
- Add participants to chats
- List all chats for authenticated users
- Only participants can access chat content

### 4. Message System
- Send messages to chat rooms
- Retrieve message history
- Messages include sender information and timestamps
- Chronological ordering of messages

### 5. Database Schema
- **User**: Extended Django user model with user_type field
- **Chat**: Name, participants (many-to-many), created_at timestamp
- **Message**: Chat reference, sender reference, content, timestamp

### 6. RESTful API
All CRUD operations exposed through REST endpoints:
- User registration and authentication
- Chat creation and listing
- Message sending and retrieval

### 7. Admin Interface
Full Django admin integration for managing:
- Users (with user type filtering)
- Chats (with participant management)
- Messages (with timestamp filtering)

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Django 5.2.7
- **API**: Django REST Framework 3.16.1
- **Database**: SQLite (for development)
- **Authentication**: Django session-based authentication
- **Python**: 3.13

```

## Security Features
- Password hashing using Django's built-in authentication
- Session-based authentication
- CSRF protection
- User authentication required for all chat operations
- Participant verification for chat access

## Testing
A custom management command (`python manage.py test_chat`) has been created to verify:
- User creation with different user types
- Chat creation with multiple participants
- Message sending and retrieval
- Database integrity

## API Documentation
Complete API documentation with curl examples is provided in `API_EXAMPLES.md`, covering:
- User registration for all user types
- Login and logout
- Chat creation and management
- Message sending and retrieval

## Admin Interface
The Django admin provides:
- User management with user type filtering
- Chat management with participant selection
- Message viewing with timestamp filtering
- Bulk actions for all models

## Database
- SQLite database for development environment
- All migrations applied successfully
- Schema supports:
  - Multiple user types
  - Many-to-many chat participants
  - Message history with timestamps

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- Add WebSocket support for real-time messaging
- Implement message read receipts
- Add file attachment support
- Implement chat search functionality
- Add user presence indicators
- Implement message reactions
- Add pagination for large chat histories
- Deploy to production with PostgreSQL

## Verification
All functionality has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Users can register with different user types
- ✅ Authentication works correctly
- ✅ Chats can be created with multiple participants
- ✅ Messages are saved and retrieved correctly
- ✅ Admin interface provides full management capabilities
- ✅ Database schema is properly structured
- ✅ API endpoints work as expected
